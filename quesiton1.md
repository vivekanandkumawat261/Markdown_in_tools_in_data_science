## 🧠 Tips

<!--  Inline Code Block -->
<p>This is  a paragraph </p>



Use inline code like `10000` to emphasize a key step target. For example, `steps > 10000` usually means a goal is achieved.

### 🧪 Sample Code Block

```xml
<steps>
  <day name="Monday" count="12500" />
  <day name="Tuesday" count="9800" />
</steps>
